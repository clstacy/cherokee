## How to Play

- Select what youâ€™d like to practice: vowels, consonants, or everything.
- Match the Cherokee symbols on the right with their English transliterations on the left.
- Use the stats at the top of the page to track your progress and see how well youâ€™re doing.
- Adjust game settings (if you want) or consult the Cheat Sheet if you need a refresher.

## What Youâ€™ll Need:

- A modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge).
- JavaScript enabled.

Thatâ€™s it! Just click and start learning.

## Features

- **Interactive Matching**  
  Click or tap on an English transliteration and then select the correct Cherokee symbol.  
- **Difficulty Settings**  
  Choose from Easy, Intermediate, or Hard. Adjust the round size, well-learned threshold, and more.  
- **Cheat Sheet**  
  Instantly see all symbols and their transliterations in a modal overlay.  
- **Progress Tracking**  
  Measures your accuracy (correct vs. total attempts) and displays progress bars for vowels, consonants, and total learned symbols.  
- **Quiz / Review Mode**  
  Quiz yourself with multiple-choice questions. The quiz is generated from the symbols youâ€™ve already matched.

## Game Settings

For those who like to fine-tune their learning experience:

- `Initial Group Size`: Control how many letters you start with.
- `Learned Threshold`: Define how many correct guesses it takes for a letter to be considered mastered.
- `New Letters`: Choose how many new letters are added at each phase.
- `Round Size`: Set how many letter pairs appear in each round.

Settings are available under the hamburger menu in the bottom-right corner. I was overwhelmed seeing so many at once, so this allows me to adjust accordingly.

## Saving Progress

Progress is automatically saved to your browser (via local storage), so you can come back later and pick up right where you left off. Itâ€™s all local, no account or login needed.
